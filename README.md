# AI in Science and Engineering
Repository containing the assignments and my solutions for the course AI in Science and Engineering offered at ETH Zurich in spring 2024.
GRADE: 6.0/6.0

The coursework was structured in three different projects, each exploring different topics covered during the course. Particular interest is given to physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs). Often, a theoretical bonus question was given to verify the ability to manipulate the theory behind these models.
